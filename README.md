# Paragraph QnA System

Paragraph QnA System is a lightweight, browser-based question-answering
application powered by TensorFlow.js. This application allows users to enter a
paragraph of text and ask questions about it, receiving AI-generated answers in
real-time without requiring any server-side processing.

## Features

- **Fully Client-Side**: Runs entirely in the browser using TensorFlow.js
- **No Server Required**: Zero backend dependencies or API keys needed
- **Interactive UI**: Modern chat interface for asking questions
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design works on all device sizes
- **Real-Time Answers**: Instant AI-powered responses based on your content

## How It Works

1. Enter a paragraph that serves as your knowledge base
2. Ask questions about the paragraph through the chat interface
3. The TensorFlow.js QnA model analyzes your paragraph and extracts relevant
   answers
4. View AI-generated responses based solely on the information in your text
